AutoPkgr Change Log
===================

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## [Unreleased][unreleased]

### Added
- Created changelog.
- AutoPkgr now displays the version number of Git and AutoPkg in the Install tab.
- Now you'll receive an email when new versions of Git, AutoPkg, or AutoPkgr are available. (#137)

### Security
- Now using three-way encryption to store SMTP password more securely. (#271)
- Improved security of the helper tool AutoPkgr uses to run in the background.
- AutoPkgr now tries to obfuscate sharepoint usernames and passwords in email notifications. (#227)

### Fixed
- Background run not updating date in status menu. (#286)
- Resolved an issue that prevented "Launch at Login" button from working in 10.8 and 10.9. (#272)
- Prevented displaying progress detail messages unnecessarily.
- Properly processes `%20` in URLs when parsing versions. (#270)
- Fixed the "Check for repo updates before each recipe run" checkbox wording.
- Fixed a bug that prevented status messages over 50 characters from being displayed in the menu.
- Fixed a bug that prevented autopkg run status from appearing in the menu.
- Made configuration options for "Run AutoPkg Now" consistent with menu items.
- Fixed a situation that prevented launchd from reading current defaults values. (#296)
- Fixes a condition where there are duplicate environment keys set in Yosemite (#284, #291)

### Changed
- Uninstall is now handled by the main app, not the helper tool.

## [1.2] - 2015-02-13

### Added
- By popular request, scheduling will now be handled by a LaunchDaemon. This allows AutoPkgr to continue running after a restart, even if nobody is logged in. (#72)
- You can now set how AutoPgkr is displayed, either as a menu item, Dock item, or both. (#10)
- You can now set AutoPkgr to launch at login. (#11)
- If the "check for repo updates" option is enabled, it will now perform the repo update prior to each `autopkg run`, rather than just when AutoPkgr is launched. This should help next time the AdobeFlashPlayer recipe changes rapidly.
- AutoPkgr now passes the recipe and override identifier into AutoPkg to avoid naming clashes when multiple repos have recipes with the same name. Thanks to @rtrouton for the suggestion. (#208)
- The AutoPkgr menu has been redesigned and enhanced with new menu options.
- Progress is now displayed during repo-update.
- We now use OS X's Notifications feature to display test email success. More notifications coming soon!
- Creating an override will now prompt for override name, allowing for the creation of multiple overrides with the same parent. (For example, `FirefoxSelfService.jss` and `FirefoxAutoUpdate.jss`.)
- When enabling a recipe, if the parent recipe is not installed, an alert will be displayed.
- Scheduled recipes will automatically be removed from the recipe list if their repo is removed, or if a repo update no longer contains the recipe.
- You can now search GitHub for AutoPkg recipes, equivalent to `autopkg search [recipe]`.
- Easy uninstall! If you ever want to uninstall AutoPkgr and its components, hold the **Option** key and choose **Uninstall** from the AutoPkgr menu icon.

### Changed
- New keychain item for AutoPkgr located at `~/Library/Keychains/AutoPkgr.keychain`. It can be unlocked and examined using the computer's serial number as the password.
- Using master JDS is now set with a checkbox. Thanks to @everetteallen for this suggestion. ([#174](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/issues/174#issuecomment-64712310))

### Fixed
- Fixed a condition that could cause preferences to be erased if an error occurs during launch.
- Fixed a condition that could cause AutoPkg to hang due to Python stdout buffer not getting flushed.
- Fixed a condition where keychain was queried for email password even when authentication was not enabled.
- Automatically removes trailing slash from JSS_URL which could cause 404 errors. Thanks to @acodega for getting to the bottom of this! ([#221](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/issues/221#issuecomment-66159456))
- Minor typo fixes and additional log entries, as always.
